  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>
      This project documents the complete modernization of a 1966 Ford F-100 into what I refer to as a
      <em>drivable engineering resume</em>. I purchased the truck in middle school following the COVID
      pandemic as a minimally functional vehicle—it could start, drive, and stop, but lacked power
      steering, power brakes, air conditioning, modern safety equipment, and reliable suspension
      geometry. The original drivetrain consisted of a Ford FE 352 paired with a worn five-speed
      transmission, and the vehicle was not suitable for consistent or safe daily use.
    </p>
    <p>
      The long-term objective of the project has been to transform the truck into a reliable,
      well-engineered vehicle while preserving its original frame and utility. Rather than performing
      a cosmetic restoration, the focus has been on system-level engineering: integrating modern OEM
      components, fabricating custom interfaces, and redesigning subsystems to function cohesively.
      Every major system—drivetrain, suspension, braking, electrical, and HVAC—has been evaluated and
      either redesigned or replaced to meet modern performance and reliability expectations.
    </p>
    <p>
      As my technical skills developed, the project evolved from a simple lowered truck into a
      platform for iterative engineering improvement. Design decisions are driven by safety,
      manufacturability, serviceability, and future modular upgrades. The truck is intentionally
      engineered to remain adaptable, allowing components to be redesigned as better solutions are
      identified. This approach mirrors real-world engineering workflows and reflects my growth in
      applied mechanical design, fabrication, and problem-solving.

  <h2>Key Engineering Decisions</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <h3>Crown Victoria Front Subframe Conversion</h3>
    <p>
      The original Ford Twin I-Beam front suspension was evaluated early in the project and ultimately
      determined to be a limiting factor for both performance and long-term reliability goals. While
      the system is durable, its geometry allows each beam to move independently, which introduces
      alignment changes throughout suspension travel.
    </p>
    <p>
      As components wear, these geometry changes commonly result in uneven front tire wear, reduced
      steering precision, and increased maintenance requirements. The steering linkage design further
      complicates adjustment and tuning, particularly when attempting to lower the vehicle.
      Additionally, the Twin I-Beam architecture significantly restricts safe ride-height reduction,
      which conflicted with the project’s design intent.
    </p>
    <div class="callout">
      Engineering assessment: The Twin I-Beam system limited alignment stability, lowering potential,
      and steering predictability, making it unsuitable for a modernized, lowered, and frequently
      driven truck.
    </div>
    <p>
      The Crown Victoria front subframe introduces modern suspension geometry with improved camber
      control, reduced tire wear, and significantly improved on-road behavior. The integrated steering
      and braking systems simplify serviceability and allow the truck to achieve a lower ride height
      while maintaining predictable suspension travel and safety margins.
    </p>

    <h3>Subframe Swap vs. Full Frame Swap</h3>
    <p>
      A full frame swap was evaluated but ultimately rejected due to the extensive cutting
      required and the loss of original truck functionality. Retaining the factory frame
      preserves bed utility and avoids heavy notching that would compromise long-term use.
    </p>
    <div class="callout">
      Design philosophy: Preserve originality where it provides value; modernize where it
      limits performance, safety, or future development.
    </div>
    <p>
      Maintaining the original rear frame architecture also enables future suspension
      upgrades that can outperform a modified Crown Victoria rear setup. This approach
      supports the long-term modularity of the vehicle as my skills, budget, and goals evolve.
